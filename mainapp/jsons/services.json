    "description": "This pretty-sounding French term, which means to sweep or paint, also has a very pretty effect on hair. During a Balayage service, which is a highlighting technique, a colorist paints bleach or haircolor just on the surface of your hair freehand; he or she doesn’t saturate the entire section with hairdye. The result is soft, natural-looking, sun-kissed highlights that easily blend in as hair grows longer.",

    "description": "In this haircolor technique, your root haircolor gradually fades into a much lighter haircolor at the ends, such as blonde. If your hair isn’t already dark, you may want your colorist to deepen your natural shade at the roots for a more dramatic Ombre. Hair stylist tip: Balayage is the technique while ombre is an end look. Your colorist will use the balayage technique to achieve an ombre.",
